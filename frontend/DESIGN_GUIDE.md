# 🎨 Cloud Kitchen Design Guide

Welcome to the Creative Team! Since you want to design this yourself, here is your map to the files.

## 1. The Color Palette (Change the Vibe)
All colors are stored in **Variables** at the top of `styles.css`. This is the modern way to style.
**File**: `frontend/styles.css`
**Lines**: 4-10 (`:root`)

*   **`--primary-color`**: Currently Orange (`#FF6B35`). Change this to change buttons and accents.
*   **`--bg-dark`**: Currently Black (`#0F0F0F`). Change this to `#FFFFFF` if you want Light Mode.

## 2. The Hero Image (The Big Banner)
The big image at the top is defined in CSS using a URL.
**File**: `frontend/styles.css`
**Search for**: `header` (Around Line 35)

```css
header {
    /* Change the URL inside the quotes to any image link you want */
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.7), rgba(0,0,0,0.9)), url('YOUR_IMAGE_LINK_HERE');
}
```

## 3. The Food Images (The Cards)
These are currently "Random" images generated by JavaScript.
**File**: `frontend/app.js`
**Search for**: `createKitchenCard` (Around Line 38)

To use your own specific images, you would usually save them in an `images/` folder, but for now, you can find cool food images on **Unsplash.com**, right-click "Copy Image Address", and paste them here.

## 2026 Design Trends to Try 🚀

### A. "Bento Grids"
Instead of a simple list, make some cards big and some small, like a Bento Box.
*   **How**: In `styles.css`, look for `#kitchen-list`. Change `grid-template-columns` to experiment.

### B. "Glassmorphism" (We have this!)
The cards look like frosted glass. You can make it stronger.
*   **How**: In `.kitchen-card`, add `backdrop-filter: blur(10px);`.

### C. "Neumorphism" (Soft 3D)
Making buttons look like they are physically pressed into the screen.
*   **How**: Requires playing with `box-shadow` using both light and dark shadows.

## Your Challenge
1.  Go to `styles.css`.
2.  Change `--primary-color` to a Hot Pink (`#FF007F`) or Gold (`#FFD700`).
3.  Refresh the page and see how the whole site changes instantly!

## 4. The HTML Structure (Changing Text & Layout)
The HTML file is the "Skeleton" of your page.
**File**: `frontend/index.html`

### A. Changing the Big Title
Look for the `header` section (Around Line 16):
```html
<h1>Cloud Kitchen</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Experience the warmth...</p>
```
*   **Action**: Change "Cloud Kitchen" to your own brand name (e.g., "Rahul's Eats" or "Desi Delights").
*   **Action**: Change the subtitle to your own slogan.

### B. Adding a Footer
Right now the page just ends. You can add a footer at the bottom (Before `</body>`):
```html
<footer>
    <p>Made with ❤️ by Rahul | © 2026</p>
</footer>
```
(You will need to style this `footer` in CSS too!)

### C. Adding New Sections
You can add more content blocks between the Header and the Kitchen List.
```html
<div class="container">
    <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
    <p>We only serve authentic home-cooked food.</p>
</div>
```
